         *   has either `marketing` or `BoxWorks` within its text. Using this
         *   operator is not necessary as we implicitly interpret multi-word

   * updated responses.
   *
   * Long polling the event stream can only be used for user events, not for
   * enterprise events.
   *
   * To use long polling, first use this endpoint to retrieve a list of long poll
   * URLs. Next, make a long poll request to any of the provided URLs.
   *
   * When an event occurs in monitored account a response with the value
   * `new_change` will be sent. The response contains no other details as
   * it only serves as a prompt to take further action such as sending a
   * request to the [events endpoint](#get-events) with the last known
   * `stream_position`.
   *
   * After the server sends this response it closes the connection. You must now
   * repeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again.
   *
   * If no events occur for a while and the connection times out you will
   * receive a response with the value `reconnect`. When you receive this response
   * you’ll make another call to this endpoint to restart the process.
   *
   * If you receive no events in `retry_timeout` seconds then you will need to
   * make another request to the real-time server (one of the URLs in the response
   * for this endpoint). This might be necessary due to network errors.
   *
   * Finally, if you receive a `max_retries` error when making a request to the
   * real-time server, you should start over by making a call to this endpoint
   * first.
